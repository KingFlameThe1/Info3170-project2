                            <h2>Paper</h2>
                            Paper is recycled by taking it to the recycling plant where it is separated 
                            and then the separated paper is cleaned and washed with soap to break it down. 
                            <br>
                            <h4>Recycling at Home</h4>
                            1. Tear the paper into small pieces and put into a blender with warm water. 
                            Blend until the mixture becomes a fairly smooth pulp. If you want to add specks of color, 
                            add pieces of colored paper at this point, then blend just a bit.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2. Assemble your “mold.” Attach your screen to your frame using duck tape, 
                            staples, or any other method that will keep the screen affixed to the frame’s edges. 
                            You’ll use your second piece of screen later in the process.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            3. Put your mold in your bin or pan of water, then pour the pulp into the mold. 
                            (If you lift the mold up, the pulp should cover the screen.) At this point, you can add decorations 
                            like dried flowers or grass, a splash of paint, or even seeds to make plantable paper. 
                            Be sure to add a little more pulp to cover the decorations so they adhere to the paper.

                            <br>
                            Some supermarkets and retailers have started collecting a wider range of plastic bags and wrappings.
                            This nay not have been adopted in your country. So check with your local recycling officials.

                            These can be included in compost as they break down completely.

                                As electronics are made of many complex and small parts. 
                                The best way to recycle them would be sending them back to the manufacturer.
                                Not all manufacturers offer this type of service and even fewer allow for it to be done
                                easily. Still, the best way to find out what to do is reach out and ask them.
